## Reading and Processing Data
```data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
## data Date

```data$date<-as.Date(data$date)

```
## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```
steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
hist(steps_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")
```

## Mean and median number of steps taken each day

```steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)
rmean <- mean(steps_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(steps_day$steps)
sprintf("MEAN of steps taken each day = %.3f", rmean)

sprintf("MEDIAN of steps taken each day = %.3f", rmedian)
```

## Average number of steps taken per Day by Interval

```steps_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)
plot(steps_interval$interval,steps_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
```
## 5-minute interval(Average) contains the maximum number of steps

```max_interval <- steps_interval[which.max(steps_interval$steps),1]
sprintf("MAXIMUM number of steps in 5-minute interval = %.0f", max_interval)

```
## computing for imputing missing data

```inc_data <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
sprintf("MISSING data = %.0f", inc_data)

imputed_NA_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```
## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day with imputed missing data

```imputed_steps_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_NA_data, sum)
hist(imputed_steps_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="yellow", xlab="Number of Steps")

hist(steps_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps", add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("yellow", "blue"), lwd=10)

```
## Mean Difference

```rmean <- mean(steps_day$steps)
imputed_rmean <- mean(imputed_steps_day$steps)
sprintf("MEAN of steps taken each day = %.3f", rmean)

sprintf("MEAN of steps taken each day with IMPUTED data = %.3f", imputed_rmean)

sprintf("The difference is %.3f ", imputed_rmean-rmean)

```
## Median difference

```rmed <- median(steps_day$steps)
imputed_rmed <- median(imputed_steps_day$steps)
sprintf("MEADIAN of steps taken each day = %.3f", rmed)

sprintf("MEDIAN of steps taken each day with IMPUTED data = %.3f", imputed_rmed)

sprintf("The difference is %.3f ", imputed_rmed-rmed)
```

## total Steps Difference

```total <- sum(steps_day$steps)
imputed_tot <- sum(imputed_steps_day$steps)
sprintf("TOTAL of steps = %.3f", total)

sprintf("TOTAL of steps with IMPUTED data = %.3f", imputed_tot)

sprintf("The difference is %.3f ", imputed_tot-total)
```

## weekdays and weekends of average number of steps taken per 5-minute intterval

```weekend <- c("Saturday", "Sunday")
imputed_NA_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(imputed_NA_data$date)),weekend), "Weekend", "Weekday"))
imputed_steps_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_NA_data, mean)

library(lattice)

xyplot(imputed_steps_interval$steps ~ imputed_steps_interval$interval|imputed_steps_interval$dow, main="Average Steps per Day by Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")
